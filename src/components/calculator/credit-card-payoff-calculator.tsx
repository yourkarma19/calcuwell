                        <AccordionContent>
                            APR, or Annual Percentage Rate, is the yearly interest generated by a sum that's charged to borrowers. For credit cards, it's the interest rate for a whole year applied to your outstanding balance. It's a key factor in how quickly your debt can grow if you don't pay it off.

                        <AccordionTrigger>Why does paying only the minimum take so long?</AccordionTrigger>
                        <AccordionContent>
                            When you make only the minimum payment, a large portion of it goes towards paying the monthly interest, with very little reducing the principal balance. This means your debt decreases very slowly, and you end up paying significantly more in interest over time. It can feel like you're running in place.

                        <AccordionTrigger>What are some effective strategies to pay off credit card debt?</AccordionTrigger>
                        <AccordionContent>
                           Two popular methods are the **Avalanche** and **Snowball** methods. With the Avalanche method, you pay off the card with the highest interest rate first, which saves you the most money. With the Snowball method, you pay off the card with the smallest balance first, which can provide a psychological boost and build momentum.
