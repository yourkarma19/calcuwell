                        <AccordionContent>
                            Return on Investment (ROI) is a performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency or profitability of an investment. It measures the amount of return on an investment relative to its cost. A high ROI means the investment's gains compare favorably to its cost.

                        <AccordionTrigger>How is ROI calculated?</AccordionTrigger>
                        <AccordionContent>
                            The formula is `ROI = (Final Value - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment * 100%`. This calculation shows the percentage gain or loss on the investment. A positive ROI indicates a profit, while a negative ROI indicates a loss.

                        <AccordionContent>
                           A "good" ROI is subjective and depends on the type of investment and its associated risk. For example, a 7-10% average annual return from the stock market is often considered good. However, a less risky investment like a government bond would have a much lower, but more predictable, ROI. The key is to compare an investment's ROI to other similar opportunities.

                        <AccordionTrigger>What are the limitations of ROI?</AccordionTrigger>
                        <AccordionContent>
                           ROI does not consider the time period of an investment. For example, a 20% ROI over one year is much better than a 20% ROI over ten years. For comparing investments over different timeframes, it's often better to use metrics that account for time, such as the Annualized ROI.
