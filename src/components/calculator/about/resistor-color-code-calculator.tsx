                <p>The **Resistor Color Code Calculator** helps you figure out the value of a resistor by reading its colored bands. This is a key tool for anyone working with electronics. It lets you find a resistor's resistance value without needing to use a multimeter. This calculator is for common 4-band resistors.</p>
                <h3>How to Use the Calculator</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Hold the resistor with the gold or silver band (the tolerance band) on the right side. Read the colors from left to right.</li>
                    <li>Select the color for each of the four bands from the dropdown menus.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The calculator will instantly show the resistor's value in Ohms (立) and its tolerance.</p>

                           The first two bands give you the first two digits of the resistance value. The third band tells you what number to multiply those digits by (a power of 10). The last band shows the tolerance.

                        <AccordionTrigger>What is Tolerance?</AccordionTrigger>
                        <AccordionContent>
                            Tolerance tells you how accurate a resistor's value is. For example, a 100 立 resistor with a 5% tolerance could have a real value between 95 立 and 105 立. A smaller tolerance means the resistor is more precise.

                            A 5-band resistor adds a third digit for more precision. The first three bands are digits, the fourth is the multiplier, and the fifth is tolerance. A 6-band resistor adds a final band that indicates how the resistance changes with temperature.
