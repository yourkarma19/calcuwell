                                <p>EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) is the fixed amount you pay each month to repay your loan. It includes both a principal amount and an interest amount. The payment is set up so that the loan is fully paid off by the end of its term.</p>

                                <p>Banks use the formula `EMI = [P x R x (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N-1]`. In this formula, P is the loan amount, R is the monthly interest rate, and N is the number of months.</p>

                                <p>You can reduce your EMI by choosing a longer tenure, finding a lower interest rate, or making a larger down payment. A longer tenure will lower the monthly payment, but you will pay more in total interest.</p>
