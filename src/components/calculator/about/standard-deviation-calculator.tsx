                <p>Our **Standard Deviation Calculator** is a tool that measures how spread out a set of numbers is. It tells you if the numbers in your data are close to the average or far apart. This calculator gives you both the population and sample standard deviation, so you have the right tool for any dataset.</p>
                
                <h3>How to Use the Calculator</h3>
                <p>Enter your list of numbers into the text box, separated by commas or spaces. The calculator will automatically find the standard deviation, variance, and mean for your data.</p>

                            <p>Standard deviation shows how much the values in a data set vary from the average (mean). A low standard deviation means the numbers are clustered close to the average. A high standard deviation means the numbers are spread out over a wider range.</p>

                            <p>Use **Population** standard deviation (Ïƒ) if your data includes every member of a group (e.g., all students in one class). Use **Sample** standard deviation (s) if your data is a smaller part of a larger group (e.g., 50 students from a school of 500). The sample formula is slightly different to give a better estimate.</p>

                           <p>A **low** standard deviation means the data is consistent and reliable. A **high** standard deviation means the data is more variable and less consistent.</p>
