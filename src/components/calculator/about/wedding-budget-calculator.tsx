                                Typically, the venue and catering are the largest parts of a wedding budget, often accounting for 50% or more of the total cost. The number of guests you invite has a direct impact on this, as catering is usually priced per person.

                            <AccordionContent>
                                There are many ways to save! Consider having your wedding on a weekday or during the off-season. Trimming the guest list is the most effective way to cut costs. You can also explore DIY options for decorations or choose a less formal catering style, like a buffet instead of a plated dinner.

                               It's wise to set aside about 5-10% of your total budget as a contingency fund. This will help you cover any unexpected expenses that arise without adding stress. The "Miscellaneous" category in our calculator can be used for this.
