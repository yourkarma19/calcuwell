        <p>The Logarithm Calculator helps you find the logarithm of any positive number to any positive base (except 1). Logarithms are the reverse of exponents. They answer the question: "To what power must we raise a base to get another number?" This tool is great for students and professionals who work with exponential growth or decay.</p>

        <h2>How to Use the Logarithm Calculator</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Enter the **Number (x)** you want to find the logarithm of.</li>
            <li>Enter the **Base (b)** for the logarithm.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The result of log b(x) will be calculated and displayed instantly.</p>

            <AccordionTrigger>What is a logarithm?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              A logarithm is the power to which a number (the base) must be raised to get another number. For example, the logarithm of 100 to base 10 is 2. This is because 10Â² = 100.

            <AccordionTrigger>Common Log vs. Natural Log</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              The **common logarithm (log)** has a base of 10 and is widely used in science. The **natural logarithm (ln)** has a base of *e* (about 2.718) and is important in math, physics, and finance for describing continuous growth.

            <AccordionTrigger>Why can't the base be 1?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              The base of a logarithm cannot be 1 because 1 raised to any power is always 1. This means you could never get any other number. This makes the operation undefined for most values.

            <AccordionTrigger>What is the Change of Base Formula?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Most calculators only have buttons for common log (base 10) and natural log (base e). To find a logarithm with a different base, you use the change of base formula: `logb(x) = logc(x) / logc(b)`. This calculator uses this formula internally.
