# **App Name**: CalcuWell

## Core Features:

- Global Search: Provides a user-friendly interface with a global search bar, instantly suggesting calculators and categories via fuzzy matching (utilizing fuse.js).
- Diverse Calculator Categories: Offers a wide range of calculators, organized into categories such as Math, Finance, Health, Programming, Conversions, and Date & Time.
- Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience across devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop) with a responsive design and a mobile-friendly numeric keypad.
- Persistent Forms: Saves calculator form values to local storage and restore them when the user returns to the page, so the user does not have to re-enter data if they accidentally close the tab or navigate away. The 'favorite calculators' and export to PDF or CSV feature were omitted to reduce scope.

- AI Powered Explanation: AI powered tool that automatically explain the formulas used in selected calculators.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft indigo (#756AB6) for a calm and intellectual feel. Indigo subtly references scientific precision.
- Background color: Very light grayish indigo (#F0F0F5).
- Accent color: Muted violet (#A69CAC) for interactive elements. This analogous hue adds visual interest.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. Space Grotesk provides a computerized feel for headlines, while Inter is neutral for the body.
- Minimal and consistent icons for calculator categories, ensuring quick visual identification.
- Clean and spacious layout with rounded cards and subtle shadows for a modern look. Prioritize clarity and ease of use.
- Subtle transitions and animations (e.g., calculator results) using Framer Motion to enhance user engagement without distraction.
