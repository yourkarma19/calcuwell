                          <AccordionContent>
                              PITI stands for Principal, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance. These are the four main components of a monthly mortgage payment. Principal is the amount that goes towards paying down your loan balance, while Interest is the cost of borrowing. Taxes and Insurance are often collected by the lender and paid on your behalf from an escrow account.

                          <AccordionTrigger>Why is it important to include taxes and insurance?</AccordionTrigger>
                          <AccordionContent>
                             Property taxes and homeowners insurance are significant ongoing costs of homeownership. Forgetting to include them in your budget can lead to a payment that is much higher than you expected. This calculator includes them to give you a more complete picture of your financial commitment.

                          <AccordionTrigger>What is loan amortization?</AccordionTrigger>
                          <AccordionContent>
                             Amortization is the process of paying off a loan over time with regular payments. In the early years of a mortgage, a larger portion of your payment goes towards interest. As you continue to make payments, more of your money goes towards paying down the principal balance. The amortization chart visualizes how much of your total payment goes to principal versus interest and other costs over the life of the loan.
